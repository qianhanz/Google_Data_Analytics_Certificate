# Course 1 Week 1 (3)

## "Optional: Familiar with data analytics? Take our diagnostic quiz"

- "Gap analysis is a method for examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get where you want to
be in the future. Examples of improvements that gap analysis can help accomplish:
    
    - Improving accessibility, 
    
    - increasing efficiency, and 
    
    - reducing carbon emissions"

- "When sharing data with others, you might use a data visualization instead of a table because visualizations are more 
aesthetically pleasing, save time when identifying trends, and are easier to understand."
    
    - Data visualization does NOT thoroughly describes each data point. 

- "A data ecosystem is the various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize,
analyze, and share data"

    - The clothing retailer's data ecosystem would include the database of sales revenue, the cloud that stores the
    database, and the records of its inventory.
    
- "Correlation: identify a relationship between two or more pieces of data."


## "Data analytics in everyday life" ##

- Businesses need a way to control all that data so they can
   
    - Improve processes
    
    - Identify opportunities and trends 
    
    - Launch new products
    
    - Serve customers
    
    - Make thoughtful decisions
    
- Data analysis: 
    - The collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make predictions, and drive 
    informed decision-making.
    
    - Turning data into insights.
    
## "Case Study: New data perspectives"

- People analytics/ human resources analytics/ workforce analytics:
    - the practice of collecting and analyzing data on the people who make up a company's workforce in order to gain 
    insights to improve how the company operates.

- How can the organization improve teh retention rate for new employees?
    
    - Ask
        - Define what the project would look like and what would qualify as a successful result
        
        - Ask effective questions and collaborated with leaders and managers who were interested in the analysis
            - Notice that at this stage the questions were designed for the leaders and managers to answer. Give analysts 
            a sense of how they (the leaders) want the project to look like (define what's a successful result).
    
    - Prepare:
        - Build a timeline, and decide how to relay progress to interested parties.
        
        - Identify what data they need to achieve the successful result identified in "Ask":
            - Develop specific questions to ask
            
            - Established rules for who has access to the data collected
            - Finalize what specific information would be gathered, and how best to present the data visually.
            - Brainstorm possible project- and data-related issues and how to avoid them.
    
    - Process:
        - Send the survey out.
        
        - Collecting and using data ethically is one of the responsibilities of data analysts.
            - Make sure all employees gave their consent to participate
            
            - Make sure all employees understand how their data would be collected, stored, managed, and protected.
            - Restrict access to the dta to a limited number of analysts
            - Clean the data to make sure it's complete, correct, and relevant.
            - Upload raw data to an internal data warehouse for an additional layer of security.
    
    - Analyze:
        - Discover trends from the completed surveys.
        
        - Document exactly what they found in the analysis, no matter what the results.
        
    - Share:
        - Share/present the report with managers.
        
        - Ask the manager to personally deliver the results to their teams.
        
            - Give managers an opportunity to communicate the results with the right context.
    
    - Act:
        - Work with leaders and decide how best to implement changes and take actions based on findings.
            - Standardize the hiring and evaluation process.
            
            - Conduct the same survey annually and compare results with those from the previous year
        
            - A comparison between the two sets of results would indicate the action plan worked.      


## "Learning Log: Consider how data analysts approach tasks" ##

- The analysts **asked** questions to define both the issue to be solved and what would equal a successful result.

- Next, they **prepared** by building a timeline and collecting data with employee surveys that were designed to be 
inclusive.

- They **processed** the data by cleaning it to make sure it was complete, correct, and relevant, and free of errors and 
outliers.

- They **analyzed** the clean employee survey data. Then the analysts **shared** their findings and recommendations with 
team leaders. Afterwards, leadership **acted** on the results and focused on improving key areas. 



## Cassie: Dimensions of data analytics ##

- Data science: the discipline of making data useful.
    
    - Machine Learning
        - Automate, in other words, make many many decisions under uncertainty.
        
        - Performance is the excellence of machine learning and AI engineer.
            - Build an automation system that performs this task with 99.99999% accuracy.
        
    - Statistics:
        - Make a few important decisions under uncertainty.
        - The excellence of statistics is rigor.
        
        - Statisticians are essentially philosophers, epistemologists. They are very very careful about protecting
        decision-makers from coming to the wrong conclusion. 
        - If that care and rigor is what you're passionate about, focus on statistics.
       
    - Analytics
        - Don't know how many decision you want to make before you begin.
        
        - Look for inspiration, want to encounter your unknown unknowns.
        
        - The excellence of an analyst is speed.
            - How quickly can you surf through vast amounts of data to explore it and discover the gems, the insights
            that are worth knowing about and bringing to your decision-makers.
            
            - "Here is a whole lot of data. No one has looked at it before. Go find something interesting."
            
            - Thrive on creative, open-ended projects.
