## "What is the data ecosystem?" ##

- Data ecosystems
    - The various elements that interact with one another in order to produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and
    share data.
    
    - Includes software and hardware tools, and people who use them

- Cloud:
    - A place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive.
   
    - Virtual location

- Data Scientists VS Data Analysts:
    - Data scientists create new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
    
    - Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to exiting questions by creating
    insights from data sources.

- Data analysis VS Data Analytics:
    - Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make 
    predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
    
    - Data analytics is the science of data.
    
- Data-driven decision-making:
    - Using facts to guide business strategy.
    
    - First, figure out the business need (find the problem that needs to be solved).
    
    - Once the question is defined, data analysts find data, analyze it, and use it to uncover trends, patterns, and
    relationships.
    
    - Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what's worked in the past, or it can guide a business to branch
    out in a whole new direction.
    
    - Important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem.
    
        - They are called **"subject matter experts"**. They can look at the results of data analysis and identify any 
        inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.
