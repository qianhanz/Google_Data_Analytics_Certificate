- Context: the condition in which something exists or happens.
    - How you organize/group your grocery list is a way to add context.
    
    - If you are playing a card game that doesn't need Joker, removing it means you understand it's out of context (the 
    game).

- Understanding context:
    - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- all those numbers exist in the context of 1 through 5
    
    - 1, 2, 4, 5, 3 -- 3 is OUT of context. 
    
    - It can get trickier. So need to listen and try to understand the full picture.
    

- Technical mindset: the ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and
logical way.

- Data design: how you organize information, like a database.

- Data strategy: the management of the people, processes and tools used in data analysis.

    - You manage people by making sure they know how to use the right data to find solutions for your problems.
    
    - For processes, it's about making sure the path to that solution is clear and accessible,
    
    - For tools, you make sure the right technology is being used for the job.
