## "What is the data ecosystem?" ##

- Data ecosystems
    - The various elements that interact with one another in order to **produce, manage, store, organize, analyze, and
    share data**.
    
    - Includes software and hardware tools, and people who use them

- Cloud:
    - A place to keep data online, rather than a computer hard drive.
   
    - Virtual location

- Data Scientists VS Data Analysts:
    - Data scientists create new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data.
    
    - Data scientists create new questions using data, while analysts find answers to exiting questions by creating
    insights from data sources.

- Data analysis VS Data Analytics:
    - Data analysis is the collection, transformation, and organization of data in order to draw conclusions, make 
    predictions, and drive informed decision-making.
    
    - Data analytics is the science of data.
    
- Data-driven decision-making:
    - Using facts to guide business strategy.
    
    - First, figure out the business need (find the problem that needs to be solved).
    
    - Once the question is defined, data analysts find data, analyze it, and use it to uncover trends, patterns, and
    relationships.
    
    - Sometimes the data-driven strategy will build on what's worked in the past, or it can guide a business to branch
    out in a whole new direction.
    
    - Important to include insights from people who are familiar with the business problem.
    
        - They are called **"subject matter experts"**. They can look at the results of data analysis and identify any 
        inconsistencies, make sense of gray areas, and eventually validate choices being made.
    
    
## "Data and gut instinct" ##
- **Ask** questions and define the problem.

- **Prepare** data by collecting and storing the information.

- **Process** data by cleaning and checking the information.

- **Analyze** data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.

- **Share** data with your audience.

- **Act** on the data and use the analysis results.

- Data + business knowledge = mystery solved
    - How do I define success for this project?
    
    - What kind of results are needed?
    - Who will be informed?
    - Am I answering the question being asked?
    - How quickly does a decision need to be made?
    
## "Origins of the data analysis process" ##

- Google Data Analytics Certificate defines data analysis life cycle as

    - Ask: Business challenge/Objective/Question
    
    - Prepare: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
    
    - Process: Data cleaning/data integrity
    
    - Analyze: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
    
    - Share: Communicating and interpreting results
    
    - Act: Putting your insights to work to solve the problem
    
- Dell EMC defines data analysis life cycle as
    - Discovery
    
    - Pre-processing data
    
    - Model planning
    
    - Model building
    
    - Communicate results
    
    - Operationalize
    
    - This model reflects the cyclical nature of real-world projects. These phases aren't static; each step connects and 
    leads to the next, and repeats. Key questions are asked to help analysts decide if they have accomplished enough to 
    move forward, spend enough time on each step, and don't start modeling before data is ready. 
    
    - Common with Google's: 
        - The first phase is interested in discovering and asking questions.
        
        - Data has to be prepared before it can be analyzed and used.
        
        - Findings should be shared and acted on.
        
        
- SAS's Iterative Life Cycle:

    - Ask

    - Prepare
    
    - Explore
    
    - Model
    
    - Implement
    
    - Act
    
    - Evaluate
    
    - The SAS model emphasizes the cyclical nature of their model by visualizing it as an infinity symbol. Besides the
    common steps that we can see in other models (ex: ask, prepare, model, act), there is one extra step after act phase
    (evaluate) desiged to help analysts evaluate their solution and potentially return to the ask phase again.
    
    
- Project-based Data Analytics Life Cycle
    
    - Identify the problem
    
    - Design data requirements
    
    - Pre-processing data
    
    - Performing data analysis
    
    - Visualize data
    

- Big Data Analytics Life Cycle

    - Business case evaluation
    
    - Data identification
    
    - Data acquisition and filtering
    
    - Data extraction
    
    - Data validation and cleaning
    
    - Data aggregation and representation
    
    - Data analysis
    
    - Data visualization
    
    - Utilization of analysis results
    
    - This life cycle appears to have more steps than previous ones but it's because it breaks down "prepare" and 
    "process" into smaller steps. It emphasizes the individual tasks required for gathering, preparing, and cleaning data 
    before the analysis phase. 
    
- Key Takeaway

    - The way we analyze data has evolved. There are different ways/models to analysis data but the same core ideas
    appear in each model of the process.
